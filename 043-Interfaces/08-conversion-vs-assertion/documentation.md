conversion is used for changing the variable from one type to another type.
assertion is only used for interfaces, to know, ehich type of value is being passed.

conversion is denoted by : datatype(variable_name), example: if we need to change a variable 'c' to int - int(c)
assertion is denoted by : variable_name.(type), example: if we need to check for datatype of variable c - c.(type)

conversion is of two types:
    widening conversion
    narrowing conversion

widening conversion - if we are converting from int to float (example)
