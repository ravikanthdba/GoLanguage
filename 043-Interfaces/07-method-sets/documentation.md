Method sets are set of methods which are attached to a type.

receivers define a mthod.
There are two types of receivers:
    value receiver
    pointer receiver

value receivers:
    When we use value receiver, the value and pointer receiver use that method.
pointer receiver:
    When we use pointer receiver, the pointers alone use that method
